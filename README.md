# Automated Metal Defect Classifier (99.30 % accuracy)

We have taken a dataset of casting manufacturing product from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ravirajsinh45/real-life-industrial-dataset-of-casting-product). And have tried to make a ml model of automation ditector for the quality of the product.
Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mould, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify.
Casting defect is an undesired irregularity in a metal casting process. There are many types of defect in casting like blow holes, pinholes, burr, shrinkage defects, mould material defects, pouring metal defects, metallurgical defects, etc.
Defects are an unwanted thing in casting industry. For removing this defective product all industry have their quality inspection department. But the main problem is this inspection process is carried out manually. It is a very time-consuming process and due to human accuracy, this is not 100% accurate. This can because of the rejection of the whole order. So it creates a big loss in the company.

We decided to make the inspection process automatic and for this, we need to make deep learning classification model for this problem.
We have created a metal defect classifier that will generall
With the help of this matel defect data set we have build a deep learning model with a accuracy of **99.30%** which will help to classifiy images as defective or okay. It will reduce error in the quality inspection and hence will save money as well as time. 

The images of the data sets look like:
